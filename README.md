### About

movieAPI is an application I developed to improve my programming/developer skills. It uses two
different projects or applicantions, one (the backend) is a Ruby on Rails API app and the other
one (the frontend) is a React.js app which uses material-ui.

The backend app repository can be found [here](https://github.com/juannodeb/movieAPI).

The frontend app repository can be found [here](https://github.com/juannodeb/movie_client).

**Live demos (Migth not work due to free dynos usage):**

Frontend in [Heroku](https://dev-movieapi-front.herokuapp.com/)

Backend in [Heroku](https://dev-movieapi-back.herokuapp.com/)

### How to use (if not using Heroku)

1. Open your terminal.

2. Choose whether you want to clone or download the repository

   ***Download:***

   Click on the Clone or download button
   Click on Download ZIP
   Choose where to save the repository
   Extract the downloaded folder

   ***Clone:***

   Check if you have git installed with `git --version`
   If not installed use for example `sudo apt-get install git` or google more ways to install it
   Click on the Clone or download button
   Copy the link given
   Go to the terminal and cd into the folder you will clone the app
   Use `git clone git@github.com:juannodeb/movie_client.git`

   ***Run the app:***

   cd into the project folder
   `npm install`
   `npm start`
   The app would use the default port (3000) to work with the back side app made with Ruby on Rails
   Your browser should automatically open the app. If this doesn't happen go to `localhost:3000` in your preferred browser

### Disclaimers

1. Made with react 17.0.1

2. Version 1.1 (Jan 2021)

3. Repository contains an still in progress React project

4. The functionality is not tested (unit-testing) nor the app is working as expected as of version 1 of the project

---

### Improvements

1. Finish MVP/full functionality of the project to work with the back side app ( currently some re-renders, redirects and protected routes not working as expected)
2. Add tests
3. Refactor on the overall project
